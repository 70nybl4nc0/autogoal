Resource manager class.

`params:`

    time_limit:int (max amount of seconds a function can run for)
    ram_limit:int (max amount of memory bytes a function can use)

`defaults:`:
    time_limit: 5 minutes
    ram_limit: 4 gigabytes

Notes: 
    - Only one function may be restricted at the same time.
      Upcoming updates will fix this matter.

    - Memory restriction is issued upon the process's heap memory size and not 
      over total address space in order to get a better estimation of the used memory.
